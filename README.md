Interpreter for a Java/C-like language written in Scheme for EECS 345: Programming Language Concepts taught by Professor Harold Connamacher at Case Western Reserve University.  Class parser and lexical analyzer was provided by Professor Connamacher.

Currently finished with parts 4/4 that interprets classes (no constructor), the main function, methods, new, dot operator (only one in a row, i.e. x.getNext() works, but not x.getNext().getNext()), variable delarations, variable assignments, mathematical operations, while and for loops (with break and continue), if/else statements, try/catch/finally.
